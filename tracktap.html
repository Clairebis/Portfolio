            Task: Implement an application prototype using React Native.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            Following a brainstorming session, the concept we worked with for
            this project was a music app aimed at allowing users to send song
            requests to a DJ / party host.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            The problems we identified were i. Users have to fight to get the
            DJ's attention, ii. Users have to compete with the music and other
            partygoers to have their request heard, and iii. DJs can struggle to
            keep track of peoples' requests manually. This gave us a starting
            point for our app.

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">1. Concept Development</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            Based on the problems we identified for both the party goers and the
            DJs, our proposed solution was that party goers would be able to
            scan a QR code around the party venue. This would allow them to join
            a party session and start requesting tracks.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            The party session would be created by the DJ, who would also have
            the option to set the genre for the session.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            When the user requests a track, it would be added to the DJs
            incoming requests list, and the DJ would be able to approve or deny
            the request.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">2. User Stories</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We created user stories so we could outline and summarise the
            functionality of our app. We followed the template "As a
            <i>role</i> I can <i>capability</i>, so that <i>benefit</i>".
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            An example of a user story we created was: "As a <i>DJ</i> I want to
            be able to <i>share the party,</i> so that
            <i>users can join the party</i>".
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We added our user stories as issues in our team Github repository.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">3. Prioritising Features</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We used MoSCoW prioritisation categorties to split our user stories
            into Must have, Should have, Could have and Won't have categories.
          </p>

        <p class="projectCardDescription">
          This was my first brief introduction to React / React Native, and it
          was a great opportunity to cooperate with and learn from the
          international students who had some experience with it.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h2 class="projectCardSub">1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            I added JavaScript to the close button in the mobile navigation menu
            to let the user return to the page they'd previously been on when
            tapping it.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            This was a small thing, but I liked how much it improved the user
            experience when they were able to tap the 'x' symbol and return to
            where they'd previously been.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">2. Stylesheets</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            It was interesting figuring out how to make the images have the
            diamond shape I'd planned for in my design.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            I set up the HTML with the images in containers. The images and
            containers had separate classes assigned to them. I could then use
            CSS to rotate the container in one direction and the image in the
            other direction to give the effect I wanted.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">3. Colours</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            I used Mapbox to show the locations of the hidden places on the
            website. This involved designing an overview map on the homepage and
            individual location-specific maps on each subpage. The primary goal
            was to enhance user experience by providing all necessary location
            information within the website, eliminating the need for users to
            visit external sites to find addresses.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            I added the Mapbox libraries to my JS and initialised the map using
            my own API key. I also customised it by adding popups with the
            location names.
