          <p class="para">
            I first came to Denmark as an Erasmus exchange student when I was
            studying law in Scotland. After returning to Scotland with my now
            husband, I finished my degree before going on a round the world trip
            and ending up back in Denmark.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            I've worked in support and compliance roles, as well as in a
            daycare in-between having children of my own. I've always loved
            learning, and when I got the opportunity to study in Denmark, I
            jumped at the chance. I enjoyed earning my AP degree in <strong>Multimedia Design</strong>, and I'm excited to build on it 
            with the top up program in <strong>Digital Concept Development</strong>. I'm looking forward to exploring 
            new career directions and discovering where this journey will take me.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            Since starting my studies, I've been able to combine my passion for
            user research and testing with a solid understanding of the development process. This overall perspective helps me
            better understand how solutions are created. Going forwards I'm keen to develop my skills in <strong>UX research and design</strong>, 
            focusing on <strong>intuitive and user-centered experiences</strong>.

            As a mum, I've mastered the art of time management and keeping many balls in the air! Life can be described as organised chaos, where teamwork is essential - especially true when it comes to finding a missing cuddly toy at bedtime!
