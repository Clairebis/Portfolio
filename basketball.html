            Task: Develop a concept and an interactive digital solution for a
            company or another external partner.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            The problem we chose to work with in this project was "How can we
            improve AGF Basketballâ€™s website to encourage more potential
            sponsors to support the club?".
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            AGF Basketball, a volunteer-led association, has an ongoing
            discussion about club growth, which requires additional funding. We
            saw an opportunity for the club to boost its financial standing by
            redesigning its website to make it easier for potential sponsors to
            access information and contact the club, hopefully attracting more
            sponsors and bringing in more funding.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We spent the first 4 weeks on research, design, testing, and
            building the first version of our solution in Wordpress. We then had
            two extra weeks to focus on our exam, and come up with additional
            ideas to enhance the solution.

        <h2 class="projectCardTitle proCo">Process</h2>
        <p class="projectCardDescription">
          We used Design Thinking to guide us throughout the project. It helped
          us keep the potential sponsors in focus and to work iteratively,
          making changes based on feedback as we went.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h2 class="projectCardSub">1. Empathise and Define</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            In this stage we got to know AGF Basketball, the target audience
            (potential sponsors), and defined the problem. We did this through
            desk and field reserach. Target audience reseach helped us discover
            some of the motivations potential sponsors have for sponsoring.
            These included:
          </p>
          <ul class="projectCardDescription bullets">
            <li>Supporting the local community</li>
            <li>Support something they're passionate about</li>
            <li>Getting some exposure for their company</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We found that lack of time to research potential sponsorship
            opportunities was one of the main challenges to sponsoring a team
            faced by local businesses.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            Based on our research, we created our persona, Peter, who guided us
            throughout the process. We also created a Business Model Canvas and
            Value Proposition Canvas. We made sure to base decisions we made on
            Peter's user goals and the business objectives. We examined the
            existing solution, looked at similar solutions, and did experience
            mapping to understand the journey a business owner would have while
            exploring sponsorship opportunities at AGF Basketball.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">2. Ideate and Prototype</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            Following a How Might We session and our analysis of the existing
            website, we realised we wanted to work with information architecture
            and redesign the layout of the site. We started tesing with Card
            Sorting, but quickly realised the task was too challenging for our
            testers. Instead, each team member worked on their own to organise
            the data. We then compared our results and created a new structure
            for the site.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We came up with our list of requirements, and did some crazy 8
            sketching to generate lots of ideas. We voted on ideas to take
            forward, and then did detailed sketches which were a valuable
            reference point for our wireframes.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            When working on our wireframes and prototypes, we considered UX
            laws, Gestalt laws, notification design. e.g. feedback, and worked
            with atomic design when creating our own design system for the
            project. We created colour styles based on our moodboard and style
            tile, and were then able to edit our components to reflect these.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">3. Testing and Iterations</h2>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            In addition to early stage Card Sorting, we did Think Aloud testing
            at lo-fi and hi-fi stages to get as much feedback as possible. We
            used feedback capture grids to gather the information and made
            changes to our designs based on the feedback.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            Overall users liked the clear structure of the site, and found it
            easy to navigate. Some changes we made based on user testing
            include:
          </p>
          <ul class="projectCardDescription bullets">
            <li>Updating the look of the cards in the "Practical" section</li>
            <li>
              Including more visuals to make the website look less text heavy
              and more appealing
            </li>
            <li>
              Adjusting the look of the sponsorship carousel to make it more
              consistent with the rest of our design.

        <h2 class="projectCardTitle proCo">Code - Implementing the solution</h2>
        <p class="projectCardDescription">
          We chose the Astra theme in Wordpress for its lightweight nature,
          speed and flexibility. We worked with Elementor, as we felt it gave us
          more control over our code than using Gutenberg blocks. We enabled the
          Flexbox container feature to help with our layouts and enabled the
          post name permalink structure to make our URLs more readable and SEO
          friendly.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h2 class="projectCardSub">1. Customisations</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            One area I focused on for customising the solution was the Senior
            and Youth Teams Accordions. The existing solution had a long list of
            the teams and team information that the user had to scroll through.
            We wanted to create an accordion so the user could open the team
            they were interested in and see information that was relevant to
            them.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            The Elementor accordion widgets didn't allow us to customise the
            accordion in the way we wanted to (information organised into
            columns, images, buttons, etc.), so I created my own accordion using
            an HTML block. I could then style this how I wanted using CSS. I
            also used JavaScript to include a for loop that added an Event
            Listener that runs a function on click. The function adds the
            .active class and toggles between showing and hiding the accordion
            panel.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We added custom CSS and JS through the Simple Custom CSS and JS
            plugin, and additional JavaScript by adding script tags in our
            custom HTML blocks.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">2. Plugins</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We used a number of plugins including:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullets projectCardDescription">
            <li>
              Smart Slider 3 - this allowed us to create a slider hero banner
              for the website, showing different images with relevant taglines
              and CTA buttons.
            </li>
            <li>
              MetForm - we used this to create various forms for the website. We
              couldn't add these forms to a form accordion as we had planned, so
              we came up with a new design using the Elementor Tabs widget to
              keep each form in a container within each tab.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">3. Further Improvements</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            During the extra time we had after handing in our project before the
            exam, one of the areas I focused on was creating a better training
            schedule. The existing solution had an image uploaded of a schedule
            created in a spreadsheet. This wasn't accessible, and the client
            would like to see the information displayed in a new way.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            I created a new schedule in a table format, where users could search
            and filter to see the information relevent to them. I used the
            DataTables plug-in for the jQuery JS library, and created the table
            in a custom HTML block.
