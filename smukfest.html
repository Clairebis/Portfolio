            Task: Improve the festival experience for the attendees, by
            providing them with a digital way to enhance their festival
            experience
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            In this project we worked to improve a mobile app for festival goers
            called "Min Festival". The app had been developed by IBM in
            cooperation with Smukfest, and they wanted our input on how we could
            improve the app and its features.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            Our aim was to improve the app to provide users with a better
            experience both while using the app and during the festival.

        <h2 class="projectCardTitle proCo">Process</h2>
        <p class="projectCardDescription">
          We used Design Thinking to guide us through the project. It helped us
          keep the user in focus and to work iteratively.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h2 class="projectCardSub">1. Empathise and Define</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            In this stage we got to know the client (Smukfest), the users, and
            defined the problem. We did this through desk and field reserach.
            User reseach helped us discover some of the problems festival goers
            face. These included:
          </p>
          <ul class="projectCardDescription bullets">
            <li>Trouble navigating the festival zone</li>
            <li>Losing and finding friends</li>
            <li>Challenges gathering memories</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            Based on our research we created our persona, Sofie, who guided us
            throughout the process. We also created a Business Model Canvas and
            Value Proposition Canvas. We made sure to base decisions we made on
            Sofie's user goals and the business objectives. We also did
            experience mapping to understand what users would be doing, thinking
            and feeling as part of their festival experience.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">2. Ideate and Prototype</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            Following a How Might We session, we did several rounds of sketching
            to generate lots of ideas.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            Some of the sketching methods we used included:
          </p>
          <ul class="projectCardDescription bullets">
            <li>Crazy 8s based on adding value to the user</li>
            <li>Crazy 8s based on specific parts of the UI</li>
            <li>Individual solution sketching</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We voted on ideas to take forward, worked out our requirements for
            the solution, then did detailed sketches and a user flow.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            When working on our wireframes and prototypes, we considered UX
            laws, notification design. e.g. feedback, and made sure to refer to
            the Design Guide we were provided with by Smukfest. The guide was
            our starting point for colours and typography, etc.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">3. Testing and Iterations</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We created some quick "rough" wireframes to allow us to carry out
            guerilla testing of various ideas we had based on our sketching
            sessions. We wanted to get feedback on them as soon as possible.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We also did Think Aloud testing at lo-fi and hi-fi stages to get as
            much feedback as possible. We used feedback capture grids to gather
            the information and made changes to our designs based on the
            feedback.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            Some features users liked and we included in our app were:
          </p>
          <ul class="projectCardDescription bullets">
            <li>
              A custom pin option to be used on the map. This helps users
              navigate the festival and personalise their experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              A friend list with notification options to allow for communication
              between friends within the app.
            </li>
            <li>
              A scanning option to improve safety at the festival. This allowed
              medical workers to scan a festival goer's wristband and reach out
              to a their emergency contact if needed.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2 class="projectCardTitle proCo">Code - Implementing the solution</h2>
        <p class="projectCardDescription">
          This was our first project using Wordpress, and we spent our time
          getting to know our way around the CMS and learning how to use it to
          create parts of our app.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h2 class="projectCardSub">1. Customisations</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We worked with a mix of the blocks available in the Gutenberg block
            editor and custom HTML blocks where we added our own code.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We added custom CSS through the Simple Custom CSS and JS plugin, and
            JavaScript by adding script tags in the HTML blocks.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">2. Plugins</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We considered a number of plugins and used e.g. the Kadence Blocks
            plugin to add tabs to our events page.
          </p>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We also used a Sticky Block plugin to make the sub-navigation fixed
            at the top when scrolling through the friends list.
          </p>

          <h2 class="projectCardSub">3. Templates</h2>
          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            We created a template in the editor for the header and bottom
            navigation bar, so we could reuse these on pages that needed them.
          </p>

          <p class="projectCardDescription">
            During coding we realised we could have made better use of the
            templates, but we took this as a learning experience we could use in
            our next project.
